#House Rules 

Have you ever wanted to play a game but couldn’t find the rules? Or maybe you have a set of alternate rules or “house rules” for the game that you’d like to remember? Multiply that by how many games you have and that can be a lot of details to remember.

That’s why we’ve built House Rules - to help game lovers save and organize the rules for your games for easy access, as well as add alternative rule sets for your games. You can also set specific games as favorites, search by game categories, and discover new games.

More details coming soon...
